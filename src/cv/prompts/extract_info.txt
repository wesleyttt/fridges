Extract the items in this receipt and populate the following (valid) JSON, everything in lowercase:

{
    "{item}": {
        "quantity": {quantity},
        "unit_price": {price / unit (round to nearest cent)} 
    },
    ...
}

Don't be overly specific on item. For example, "ORGANIC LF VANILLA YOG- 32 OZ." should just be "vanilla yogurt".
