Generate a recipe that uses as many of these ingredients as possible. The recipe should be practical and easy to follow.
Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
{{
    "name": "Recipe Name",
    "ingredients": [
        {{"name": "Ingredient 1", "quantity": "Amount"}},
        {{"name": "Ingredient 2", "quantity": "Amount"}}
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Step 1: ...",
        "Step 2: ..."
    ],
    "cooking_time": "Estimated cooking time",
    "servings": "Number of servings"
}}

Only respond with the JSON object, no additional text.
